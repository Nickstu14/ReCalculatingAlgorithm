get the pos of the NPC
set all the movement cost values
add the starting point to an open list
look at nodes surrounding point A, these are parents, assign a number to the vertical and horizontal, this will be stored in movement cost (G)
drop point A into closed list, this list will be apart of the path


 To Do
========

Add the cursor to a new thread. at the moment due to the timer function the cursor prossess is slowed down.

Add in the help text menu
impliment the toggle text information

Add the rescan function may also have to 

rescan function is implimented but is extreamly buggy, unfortunatly the way this code is designed there will need to be a memory method where the code remembers the original path for backtracking


Looked into
===========
converting thekeyboard input into a switch statement instead of haveing loads of if's (doesn't work)


Debug info
==========
Added in a debug help menu
press F1 to access menu (can't access any debug info without pressing F1 first) | This will also show mouse pos and game speed
press T to show the total cost text on the map
press R to reset the map entirely
press 1-4 to show the CM Terminal maps
	1 - prints basic grid
	2 - prints estimated cost
	3 - prints move cost
	4 - prints total cost

Controlls / can be used without pressing F1 however no text to say until F1 is pressed.
=========
press P to pause game
press I to slow down the game
press O to speed up the game



bug fixed
========
after so many turns the goal stops spawning, fixed by; if the goal cannot be found then respan goal. (still exisits)
the move cost wasn't adding the current cell's value

Bugs
====
Need to look at the move cost, seems to overwrite values.
